Duration: 3 Day Sprint

Directly above this is how long it took you to develop the project. Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?
User interface where the user can input two values (2 input elements) and the select type of mathematical operation. When the submit (`=` button) is clicked, the input is captured, bundled up in an object, and sends the object to the server via a POST. There is also a 'C' button that will clear the user input fields.

A list of all previous calculations loads on the page through a GET request.  The list is updated when a new calculation is made.
